This is a tool to manage assets in the FEVM system. It is a smart contract factory which can create reward splitter on the go. One can use this tool to create a reward splitter for a new asset and then use the splitter to distribute rewards to the asset holders.

One needs to add the addresses of the receivers and the percentage of the reward to be distributed to each receiver. The tool will then create a reward splitter contract and deploy it on the blockchain.

The smart contract can receive any type of tokens and distribute them to the receivers. All tokens including the Native Fil Token and any ERC20 token can be collected and distributed.
